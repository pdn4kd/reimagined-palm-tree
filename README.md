Spectrograph performance, both in terms of an exposure time calculation for a target SNR, and RMS velocity error for input signal and stellar parameters.

Pulls RV signal data in from a precalculated table (Beatty and Gaudi, 2015), Stellar brightness from precalculated spectra (BT-Settl).

All wavelengths are in ångströms, and all velocities are in km/s.
